      <p>
        Since we're a team of modders (hi, I'm
        <a href="https://github.com/steviegt6">Tomat</a>, and this is
        <a href="https://github.com/OliHeamon/">Oli</a>), we're developing mods.
        While we have many personal projects, our list of projects under the
        Team Catalyst name is modest.

              <h2>Nitrate</h2>
              <p>
                An aggressive optimization mod for Terraria that moves a lot of
                rendering to the GPU, parallelizes many operations, and (when
                possible) swaps out XNA numerics types for JIT
                instrinsic/SIMD-accelerated types/operations. Still in its
                infancy, Nitrate is being worked on constantly with a
                no-compromises mindset to speed the game up as much as feasibly
                possible while preserving the vanilla user experience.

          <p>Here's some extra info to fill the dead air.</p>
          <p>
            We are a group of Terraria modders looking to improve user
            experience through a variety of means. We are currently focusing on
            Nitrate, a performance optimization mod for Terraria.

            If you haven't been able to tell by our totally-not-obnoxious
            advertising, we have a
            <a href="https://patreon.com/CatalystTeam">Patreon</a> that you may
            graciously donate to to support us and encourage us to continue
            developing mods for everyone. Our work will always be free, so
            there's no pressure!
